Here's a comprehensive set of example documentation for your Flask API, including examples in Python, Node.js, and `curl`. This documentation outlines how to use the `/ai/api/v1/response` endpoint.

# API Documentation: `/ai/api/v1/response`

## Overview

The `/ai/api/v1/response` endpoint allows you to interact with a generative AI model. You can send a message and receive a response from the AI, while also managing chat history. Access to this endpoint requires a valid API key.

## Endpoint

### `GET /ai/api/v1/response`

**Description**: Sends a message to the AI and retrieves a response. Optionally, you can provide a chat history and an API key.

## Query Parameters

- `message` (string, required): The message you want to send to the AI.
- `api_key` (string, required): Your API key for authentication.
- `chat_history` (string, optional): A JSON-encoded list of previous chat messages to maintain context.

**Example `chat_history`**:
```json
[
  {"user": "Hi there!", "bot": "Hello, how can I help you?"},
  {"user": "Can you tell me a joke?", "bot": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he's outstanding in his field!"}
]
```

## Responses

- **200 OK**: Returns a JSON object with the AI's response and updated chat history.
- **400 Bad Request**: Returned if the `message` parameter is missing or if `chat_history` is invalid.
- **403 Forbidden**: Returned if the `api_key` is invalid.

## Example Requests

### Using `curl`

**Request**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/ai/api/v1/response?message=What%20is%20the%20weather%20like%20today%3F&api_key=sigma&chat_history=%5B%7B%22user%22%3A%22Hi%2C%20there%21%22%2C%22bot%22%3A%22Hello%2C%20how%20can%20I%20help%20you%3F%22%7D%2C%20%7B%22user%22%3A%22Can%20you%20tell%20me%20a%20joke%3F%22%2C%22bot%22%3A%22Why%20did%20the%20scarecrow%20win%20an%20award%3F%20Because%20he%27s%20outstanding%20in%20his%20field%21%22%7D%5D"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "This is a simulated response based on your message.",
  "chat_history": [
    {"user": "Hi there!", "bot": "Hello, how can I help you?"},
    {"user": "Can you tell me a joke?", "bot": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he's outstanding in his field!"},
    {"user": "What is the weather like today?", "bot": "This is a simulated response based on your message."}
  ]
}
```

### Python Example Using `requests`

**Code**:
```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/ai/api/v1/response"
params = {
    'message': 'What is the weather like today?',
    'api_key': 'sigma',
    'chat_history': '[{"user":"Hi there!","bot":"Hello, how can I help you?"},{"user":"Can you tell me a joke?","bot":"Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he\'s outstanding in his field!"}]'
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params)
print(response.json())
```

### Node.js Example Using `axios`

**Code**:
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const url = 'http://localhost:5000/ai/api/v1/response';
const params = {
  message: 'What is the weather like today?',
  api_key: 'sigma',
  chat_history: JSON.stringify([
    { user: 'Hi there!', bot: 'Hello, how can I help you?' },
    { user: 'Can you tell me a joke?', bot: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he\'s outstanding in his field!' }
  ])
};

axios.get(url, { params })
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
  });
```

### JavaScript (Fetch API)

**Code**:
```javascript
const url = new URL('http://localhost:5000/ai/api/v1/response');
const params = {
  message: 'What is the weather like today?',
  api_key: 'sigma',
  chat_history: JSON.stringify([
    { user: 'Hi there!', bot: 'Hello, how can I help you?' },
    { user: 'Can you tell me a joke?', bot: 'Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he\'s outstanding in his field!' }
  ])
};

Object.keys(params).forEach(key => url.searchParams.append(key, params[key]));

fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request**: Ensure all required parameters are included and correctly formatted.
- **403 Forbidden**: Verify that the API key is correct and included in the query parameters.
